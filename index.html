        <!--
            Bypassed the label's for attribute by placing the input inside.
            Added required attribute so the input field cannot be left blank.
            Minlength prevents characters from being under the required amount.
            A tool tip will popup if requirements aren't met.

        </label>
        <!--Changed email type from email to text because leaving it as email would allow invalid emails to submitted as long as the have @ symbol. For example, 1@1 would be considered valid. Also, it would be able to bypass altogether using devtools. Using javascript instead would be a better option to prevent this.-->
